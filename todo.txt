ToDo list:

NOW
-Add proper discord invite ✅
-Add limits on the profile page to the name and bio ✅
-Change the create page to confirm by Alt + Enter so text can be broken onto new lines ✅
-make post creator name clickable to their profile ✅

-Allow images to be made bigger by clicking them ✅
-Allow the routing to the indiv post through home etc and the pfp
-Add a limit to how many posts show on homepage and add a button to show more
-Add recent posts

UPCOMING
-add gridFS as a storing option on the create page for anything above 16MB
-There is probably a more efficient system to retrieve the current logged in user rather than getting all of them so please have a look at that and implement it 
-Settings page

END
-update temrs and agreements and make privacy policy
-change the v=if="true" for the create page back to authenticated

To be reviewed
-Allow video and photo links rather than downloaded imbeds only
-add a loading screen

Is this a bad thing?
-Change it so the posts arent loaded every refresh or page change
