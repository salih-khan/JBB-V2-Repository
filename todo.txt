------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
********* Timeline feature to be implemented and developed

UPCOMING
-add gridFS as a storing option on the create page for anything above 16MB
-There is probably a more efficient system to retrieve the current logged in user rather than getting all of them so please have a look at that and implement it 
-Possibly update it so the "user_2390845" is used instead of a long id for the S3 bucket
-Have a reload since going back after logging out takes images and info from cache

END
-update temrs and agreements and make privacy policy

To be reviewed
-Allow video and photo links rather than downloaded imbeds only

Is this a bad thing?
-Change it so the posts arent loaded every refresh or page change
