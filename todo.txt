ToDo list:

NOW
Add limits on the profile page to the name and bio 
-Change it so the posts arent loaded every refresh or page change

UPCOMING
-add gridFS as a storing option on the create page for anything above 16MB
-There is probably a more efficient system to retrieve the current logged in user rather than getting all of them so please have a look at that and implement it 

END
-update temrs and agreements and make privacy policy
-change the v=if="true" for the create page back to authenticated
